# Dobby_RISCV
A project on design of RISC-V processor from RTL specfication to GDS|| generation. Below is the summary of the core.

## Top level view of the design

Core Details:

- core implementing the RISC-V ISA (I- Integer extensions, M- Multiplication and division extension)  2 non maskable interrupt inputs 
- 16 kB on-chip PRAM, used as  program memory(also used as DRAM for unused locations). 
- External bus interface with slave memory for extension of the storage.  
- Init-controller for PRAM  initializations (copies the machine code from the external memory to internal memory)
- memory-controller controls access  to PRAM and the external bus interface based on Memory layout.

## Memory Address Mapping information
- Byte Addressable memory used
- Mapping and access decided in Memory controller
- Core address output 32bits -> Upper 15 bits of the address ignored and rest used as shown below
- SRAM macros were used for these (4 blocks of 4kB each)

## Service routines

Details of the service routines for interrupts and system calls are shown below

## Bus interfaces
- Customised Interface
- Bus Data write and read based on Slave ready.
- Data gets latched once cycle later than all signals
- BUS multiplexing possible.
